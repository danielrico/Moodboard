Moodboard
=========

Wordpress theme for http://www.daniel-rico.com/moodboard

A simple moodboard system using masonry to display a wall of images filtered by categories. All images are linked to the source URL so moodboard consists of a single page.

It uses Advanced Custom Fields free plugin http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/

If you want to collaborate with different users with different authorization level, I recommand using Press permit plugin : http://presspermit.com/

If you want your moodboard to remain private you can use Private only plugin : https://wordpress.org/plugins/private-only/
